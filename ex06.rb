#Study drills

#1. String interpolation positions:
 # - in variable x
 # - in variable y (twice)
 # - in strings on line 19 and 20
 # - in variable joke_evaluation

#2. Using w + e concatenates the string value in each variable

#3. String interpolation doesn't appear to work with single quoted strings. Single-quoted strings puts string as is
